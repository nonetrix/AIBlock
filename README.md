host file to block low effort AI generated article sites 

This blocks those annoying sties that are obviously made by an AI or someone who is paid less than minimium wage and or doesn't understand English to make useless articles that have nothing to do with the subject

For example the site that annoyed me enough to make this:
https://www.aidsquilt.org/best-rss-feeds/

I will add them as I come by them if you find one please make an pull request or an issue if you don't know how host files work
